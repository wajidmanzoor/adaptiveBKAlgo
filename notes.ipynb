    "1. Let M(G) denote the set of all maximal cliques of G. It is known that there exist n-vertex graphs with $3^{n‚àï3}$ maximal cliques\n",
    "2. Worst case of running pivot is $3^{n/3}$, but is faster in practice on sparse graphs"

    "1. Pivot in Bron‚ÄìKerbosch (Tomita variant)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pivot is used to minimize the number of recursive calls.\n",
    "- A pivot vertex `u` is selected from `P ‚à™ X`, typically the one with the maximum number of neighbors in `P`\n",
    "- The algorithm then explores only vertices in `P` that are *not* adjacent to `u`** (i.e., `P \\ N(u)`).\n",
    "- **Might not be possible in implement in our**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remove vertices with degree less than current clique size, **can be easily implemented**\n",
    "3. Connected Component Decomposition \n",
    "   - Decomposing `P` into connected subgraphs ensures each component is processed independently.\n",
    "   - **Can be implemented on `ExpandTo`**.\n",
    "4. If vertex v has a neighborhood that is a subset of vertex u‚Äôs neighborhood (i.e., $N(v)‚äÜN(u)$, then every clique that contains v also contains u.\n",
    "Hence, v can never generate a new maximal clique that doesn‚Äôt already include u. **Can we used initially to shrink ExpandFrom**\n"
